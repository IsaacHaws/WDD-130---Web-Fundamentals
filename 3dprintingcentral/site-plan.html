        Welcome to 3D Printing Central! 3D printing has huge benefits for many people so we intend to teach you the basics of 3D printing and how to harness your inner maker into this hobby. 3D printers have many opportunities for many applications. 3D printers are now helping doctors create cast, manufactures design and make needed parts, and much more. So let’s dig in!!

      <h3>3D Printing Basics</h3>
      <p>
        3D printers are compact machines that are able to create 3D dimensional objects using a series of motors to move a printing surface and a nozzle. The printing bed is a flat plate often made of glass or other materials made to help with the adhesion and removal of your 3D model. The nozzle is what heats up the filament to a set temperature and places it on the bed. The 3D objects are made by heating up filament through the nozzle to where it is malleable but not to the point where it will run. Then, by moving the bed and the nozzle in unison, it lays layer upon layer of material, creating a 3D object.  
        There are two basic kinds of 3D printers, differentiated by the ways they move the bed and the nozzle. The most basic kind of 3D printer is where the bed and the nozzle move separately on two different axes. By moving the bed forward and back and the nozzle side to side simultaneously, the printer can create complex shapes such as a hexagon, octagon, circle, square or all of them combined. After finishing the current layer, the nozzle raises a predetermined height to prepare to apply the next layer upon the previous one. This process continues until the model is complete. The other basic kind of 3D printer is where the printing bed moves up and down while the nozzle moves forward and back and side to side. Both kinds accomplish the same thing just in different ways.

      </ul>
      <h3>Leveling</h3>
      <p>
        Leveling your bed is the most important thing you do to your 3D printer. It is necessary to obtain a level bed to even start your 3D prints. To level your bed, you must calibrate the distance of the nozzle to height of the bed. 
        To have a successful print, you must do this at least at the four corners of the bed allowing a flat surface for printing. Even with a level bed, there is more to work to be done to achieve a surface ready to 3D print on. 
        Along with a level bed, it is essential to make sure the first layer sticks to the printer bed to ensure the rest of the layers above it are as even as possible. Cleaning your bed surface before each print will ensure that the first layer will adhere to the surface. 
        While most 3D printers come with a bed surface that helps the filament stick to the bed, sometimes you will need to help the filament stick. Almost all 3D printers have a heated bed. This greatly improves the quality and success of the first layer. 
        Applying a sticky adhesive to the bed will allow the first layer to hold to the bed. There are a wide variety of adhesives that 3D printers use to ensure the adhesion of this first layer. Glue, butter, and hairspray are among the most common materials used to help this process. 
        Sometimes this method is not necessary as you can buy a replacement for your bed that helps your first layer stick. Leveling your printer is a skill that take time to learn. You won’t be able to level your 3D printer perfectly your first time. The best way to learn how to level your 3D printer is repetition. 
        Every 3D printer is slightly different so one way of leveling will not work for every printer. After time and practice, you will find the individuality your printer has and will learn how to tune it as desired.
