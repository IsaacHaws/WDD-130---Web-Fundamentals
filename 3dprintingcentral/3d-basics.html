            <p class="basics_text">3D printers are compact machines that are able to create 3D dimensional objects using a series of motors to move a printing surface and a nozzle. The printing bed is a flat plate often made of glass or other materials made to help with the adhesion and removal of your 3D model. The nozzle is what heats up the filament to a set temperature and places it on the bed. The 3D objects are made by heating up filament through the nozzle to where it is malleable but not to the point where it will run. Then, by moving the bed and the nozzle in unison, it lays layer upon layer of material, creating a 3D object.  
                There are two basic kinds of 3D printers, differentiated by the ways they move the bed and the nozzle. The most basic kind of 3D printer is where the bed and the nozzle move separately on two different axes. By moving the bed forward and back and the nozzle side to side simultaneously, the printer can create complex shapes such as a hexagon, octagon, circle, square or all of them combined. After finishing the current layer, the nozzle raises a predetermined height to prepare to apply the next layer upon the previous one. This process continues until the model is complete. The other basic kind of 3D printer is where the printing bed moves up and down while the nozzle moves forward and back and side to side. Both kinds accomplish the same thing just in different ways.
