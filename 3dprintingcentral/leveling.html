                <p class="leveling_text1">Leveling your bed is the most important thing you do to your 3D printer. It is necessary to obtain a level bed to even start your 3D prints. To level your bed, you must calibrate the distance of the nozzle to height of the bed. 
                    To have a successful print, you must do this at least at the four corners of the bed allowing a flat surface for printing.

                    <p class="leveling_text2">Even with a level bed, there is more to work to be done to achieve a surface ready to 3D print on. 
                        Along with a level bed, it is essential to make sure the first layer sticks to the printer bed to ensure the rest of the layers above it are as even as possible. Cleaning your bed surface before each print will ensure that the first layer will adhere to the surface. 
                        While most 3D printers come with a bed surface that helps the filament stick to the bed, sometimes you will need to help the filament stick. Almost all 3D printers have a heated bed. This greatly improves the quality and success of the first layer. 
                        Applying a sticky adhesive to the bed will allow the first layer to hold to the bed. There are a wide variety of adhesives that 3D printers use to ensure the adhesion of this first layer. Glue, butter, and hairspray are among the most common materials used to help this process. 
                        Sometimes this method is not necessary as you can buy a replacement for your bed that helps your first layer stick.

                <p class="leveling_text3">Leveling your printer is a skill that take time to learn. You wonâ€™t be able to level your 3D printer perfectly your first time. The best way to learn how to level your 3D printer is repetition. 
                    Every 3D printer is slightly different so one way of leveling will not work for every printer. After time and practice, you will find the individuality your printer has and will learn how to tune it as desired.
